# Resume as an NPM packege

This simple package contains my resume (or CV), that can be installed as an npm package and
accessed via CLI.   

The package uses [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to prompt a list of
choises for the use to choose from.  

The resume comes in two languages : *English* and *French*
